The owner of an Ioun Stone can cast Ritual of Attunement on himself or herself to attune to the stone. The spell takes 1 minute to cast, and the only material component required is the stone itself.\n\nAn Ioun Stone returns to its owner’s possession when found or created by another, remaining in orbit around the owner’s head until the owner or creator takes possession of it again.
