A creature that knows the mirror’s nature makes the save with Advantage, and Constructs succeed on the save automatically.\\n\\nAn extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled with thick fog that reduces visibility to 10 feet.

A freed creature appears in an unoccupied space within sight of the mirror but facing away from it.

The creature named or contained in the named cell appears as an image on the mirror’s surface. You and the creature can then communicate.\\n\\nIn a similar way, you can take a Magic action and use a second command word to free one creature trapped in the mirror. The freed creature appears, along with its possessions, in the unoccupied space nearest to the mirror and facing away from it.\\n\\nPlacing the mirror inside an extradimensional space created by a Bag of Holding, Portable Hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane.
